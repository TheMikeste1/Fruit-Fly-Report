\section{Conclusions}
To reiterate what was shown throughout our paper, the goal of our research was to create a drone capable of multi-apple detection and enumeration.
Although we weren't able to create a product capable of accomplishing the initial goal, we were able to provide a ``proof of concept'' so to speak.
The models that we used were consistently lightweight and reportedly capable of performing with minimal training data. 
Although we experienced a decent amount of success using these models, we lacked the data, training time, and compute capacity to create a model that was consistently performant and accurate.
We suspect that given a larger, more diverse dataset, we would be able to produce more accurate models. 
We concluded that despite the shortcomings of a drone, such as short battery life
The code for the project can be found in~\cite{FruitFly}.
