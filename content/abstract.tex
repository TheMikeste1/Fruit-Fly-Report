    Farmers face numerous challenges when maintaining their crops, one of which is
    knowing when their crops are ripe.
    In particular, orchards can be difficult to manage and fruit can hide in branches.
    There is a need to develop a technique to assist farmers in maintaining their
    orchards.
    Modern technologies provide ways to develop models to detect the ripeness of
    crops, such as apples.
    We developed an intelligence hierarchy to use flying drones to assist in the
    maintenance of orchards by identifying ripe apples.
