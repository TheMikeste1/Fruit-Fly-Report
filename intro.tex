%  Present topic and goal
Farmer's require a lot of land in order to grow their crops.  % Farming takes immense amounts of time and energy?
In the U.S., apple orchards take up approximately 322 thousand acres of land. %TODO cite acrage of apple orchards line https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/fruits/apples
Our project focuses on helping farmer's manage crops across their many acres of land by making use of a drone equipped with machine learning models to 
find apples within the orchard and predict their ripeness and health. By avoiding the need for manual inspection of apples over this large area 
we can lower the time demand for farmer's, and provide a more standardized method of determining crop health by removing the subjectivity of human decision making.\\
