\subsection{Initial Object Detection}
As the intelligence hierarchy demonstrates, the first component of our model needed to be able to detect when an apple appeared in the drone's field of view. 
We trained a lightweight convolutional nueral network (CNN), that was based off of MobileNet 
In order to do this, we selected a Haar-Cascade model because of its lightweight nature, simplicity, and its real-time object detection capabilities.
