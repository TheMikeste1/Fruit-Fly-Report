\subsection{Initial Object Detection}
As the intelligence hierarchy demonstrates, the first component of our model needed to be able to detect when an apple appeared in the drone's field of view. 
In order to do this, we selected a Haar-Cascade model because of its lightweight nature, simplicity, and its real-time object detection capabilities.
