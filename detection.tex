\subsection{Initial Object Detection}
As the intelligence hierarchy demonstrates, the first component of our model needed to be able to detect when an apple appeared in the drone's field of view. 
We trained a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), that was based off of MobileNet~\cite{Sandler2018,PyTorchMobileNet} in order to accomplish this. 
In order to do this, we selected a Haar-Cascade model because of its lightweight nature, simplicity, and its real-time object detection capabilities. The Haar-Cascade model was trained using a graphical user interface created by Amin Ahmadi\footnote{\url{https://amin-ahmadi.com/cascade-trainer-gui/}}. The data we used to train the model was a compilation of data sets such as the Fruit360 data set \cite{Fruit360}.
