\subsection{Robot Design}\label{subsec:robot-design}
For this project, we elected to use a flying Tello drone.
We chose a flying drone primarily because it can easily bring its camera into detection range of apples in a tree, regardless of height.
A flying drone also has the advantage of not disturbing or careing about the terrain, w

        The intelligence hierarchy used by the drone.
        Each layer is designed to minimize the work done by the controller so it does not perform expensive calculations except when needed.

        A data flow diagram of how the intelligence hierarchy works.
        The controller, which operates on another machine receives input from the drone's cameras and other sensors.
        This information is passed to a lightweight model, then to heavier models to operate the drone and determine fruit ripeness.
