        The intelligence hierarchy used by the drone.
        Each layer is designed to minimize the calculations performed by the controller so it does not perform expensive calculations except when needed.

        A data flow diagram of how the intelligence hierarchy works.
        The controller, which operates on another machine receives input from the drone's cameras and other sensors.
        This information is passed to a lightweight model, then to heavier models to operate the drone and determine fruit ripeness.
