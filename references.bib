abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture is an important parameter in irrigation scheduling and application. Knowledge of root zone volumetric water content can support decisions for more efficient irrigation management by enabling estimation of required water application rates at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. The study presented here proposes a data mining approach that combines known field conditions with remote sensing observations to provide probabilistic estimates of root zone soil moisture at three different depths in the root zone soil profile. Bayesian data mining algorithms were tested and calibrated to combine the remotely sensed spatial information with field measurements. The remote sensing platform used in this study, called AggieAir™, is an unmanned autonomous aerial system developed by the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University. Finally, a trapezoidal integration method was used to estimate volumetric water content (VWC) in the root zone using the results of the modelling approach at three different depths in the root zone soil profile. The results show the model could estimate the root zone VWC with good accuracy (RMSE =0.05, MAE = 0.04, r = 0.97, e = 0.92, R2 = 0.94). Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = "Detection of rotten fruits is very crucial for agricultural
              productions and fruit processing as well as packaging industries.
              Usually, the detection of fresh and rotten fruits is done
              manually which is an ineffective and lengthy process for farmers.
              For this reason, the development of a new classification model is
              required which will reduce human effort, cost, and production
              time in the agriculture industry by recognizing defects in the
              fruits. This article offers a major dataset to the researchers to
              develop effective algorithms for recognizing more variety of
              fruits and overcome the limitations by increasing accuracy as
              well as decreasing computation time. This dataset contains
              sixteen types of fruit classes, namely fresh grape, rotten grape,
              fresh guava, rotten guava, fresh jujube, rotten jujube, fresh
              pomegranate, rotten pomegranate, fresh strawberry, rotten
              strawberry, fresh apple, rotten apple, fresh banana, rotten
              banana, fresh orange, rotten orange. We collected various fresh
              and rotten fruit images from 16th to 31st March 2022 from
              different fruit shops and real fields with the help of a domain
              specialist from an agricultural organization. The dataset is
              hosted by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
              Jahangirnagar University, and is freely available at
