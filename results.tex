\subsection{Model Performance}\label{subsec:model-performance}
Overall, the models developed as part of the intelligence hierarchy performed fairly well.
\autoref{fig:apple-tree-mode-training-curve} demonstrates a learning curve for one of the first-layer apple-in-view models.

        Learning curve for a apple-in-view CNN.
        The model is a retrained version of MobileNet~\cite{Sandler2018,PyTorchMobileNet}, which is a more light-weight while still very powerful CNN.
        Loss is in mean squared error.
